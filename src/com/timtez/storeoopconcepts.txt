I apologize for the confusion earlier. Here are some ways you can improve the Store class to follow SOLID principles:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): The Store class should have only one reason to change. In other words, it should have only one responsibility. In your current implementation, the Store class is responsible for managing cashiers, products, and financial accounts. You can split these responsibilities into separate classes, such as CashierManager, ProductManager, and AccountManager, to make the Store class more focused on its core responsibility, which is to provide access to the products and accounts of the store.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP): The Store class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new features to the Store class without modifying its existing code. One way to achieve this is to use interfaces to define the behavior of the Store class and its collaborators. For example, you can define an IProductManager interface to encapsulate the behavior of the product management component, and you can implement this interface in a separate class that handles the product-related operations.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): The Store class should be able to substitute its subclasses without changing the correctness of the program. In other words, the Store class should be designed to work with different types of stores (e.g., online store, physical store) without breaking the program. To achieve this, you can define an abstract Store class that provides a common interface for all stores, and you can implement this interface in separate classes for each type of store.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): The Store class should not be forced to depend on interfaces that it does not use. In other words, you should avoid defining large, monolithic interfaces that require clients to implement methods they do not need. Instead, you should define smaller, focused interfaces that correspond to specific use cases. For example, you can define a IProductAvailabilityChecker interface that provides a method to check the availability of a product, and you can define a separate IProductUpdater interface that provides a method to update the product quantity.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): The Store class should depend on abstractions, not on concretions. This means that you should define abstract interfaces or classes that describe the behavior of the components that the Store class depends on, and you should inject these abstractions into the Store class instead of concrete implementations. For example, you can define an IAccountManager interface that describes the behavior of the account management component, and you can inject an instance of this interface into the Store class at runtime.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
